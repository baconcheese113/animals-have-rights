        <p class="preview__snippet">
          The animal rights movement is often considered to have been an
          outgrowth of the environmental movement, but it actually preceded the
          environmental movement by about 100 years. It was part of a movement
          that began just after the Civil War, both in England and in the United
          States, for the protection of children and animals.

          The Sad Slaughter of Elephants for their Tusks
        </h2>
        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
          A massacre of the world's elephants is going on right now. One hundred
          thousand African elephants were been killed by poachers between
          2010-2012 and the total population of elephants in Africa has declined
          64% in a decade.<br />This slaughter is occurring because elephants
          are killed for their tusks. Ivory has long been a status symbol in
          Asia and increased prosperity in China and southeast Asia has allowed
          a newly created middle class to purchase ivory on the black market.

          PROJECT and it is about the creation of safe corridors for animals
          throughout the continent. There are four proposed corridors
          (wildways??) three of them running North-South and one going
          East-West.

        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
          We have inherited an earth in danger and that danger is particularly
          apparent in the war on predators that we have waged for centuries.
          Predators are essential to any ecosystem because they keep the prey
          species in balance with what the ecosystem can support.<br />Predators
          and prey will always come to a balance because if there are too many
          predators (e.g. wolves, coyotes, mountain lions, bears) the prey
          species will decline in numbers.

          Antibiotics in Animal Feed Endangers Our Health
        </h2>
        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
          One of the greatest health hazards facing the world today is the
          looming prospect of a world without effective antibiotics. We rely on
          them to nurse us back to health in a variety of situations where, in
          pre-antibiotic times, infections formerly endangered and killed
          millions of people.<br />The usefulness of antibiotics is now facing a
          critical challenge. Dr. Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the
          World Health Organization, warned in 2011 that "in the absence of
          urgent corrective and protective actions, the world is heading toward
          a post-antibiotic era, in which many common infections will no longer
          have a cure and, once again, kill unabated..."

        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
          Pigs are highly intelligent animals and many experts believe that
          their intelligence is equal to, or greater than, that of dogs. As well
          as intelligence they have sensitivity to their living conditions. Like
          us, they need food, shelter, exercise, stimulation and love.<br />One
          pig who has been taken into a home is the famous pig, "Esther". She
          lives in Canada with two humans who adopted her and then became vegans
          because of their love for her.

        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
          How to pick a jury in animal cases is a subject that has not been
          explored extensively. Most civil cases involving animals are settled;
          criminal cases are usually negotiated. However, if a case goes to
          trial, you will have an extensive examination of the jury panel, and I
          want to suggest some ideas you can use in selecting the jury.<br />Picking
          a jury begins with a process called voir dire, which means "to speak
          the truth;" however, that is hardly an accurate appraisal of what goes
          on in a jury selection process.

          <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
              Ag-Gag is the term used to describe a series of anti-whistleblower laws in the U.S. Though they vary in details, the essence of these laws is that they criminalize the taking of undercover videos of abusive practices in the animal agriculture industry. Some of these laws criminalize the taking of videos documenting inhumane factory farming practices without the owner's consent, while others criminalize the application for employment in factory farms without disclosing the applicant's links to the press or to organizations concerned with animal welfare. A third variant, which pretends to help the animals, requires that any evidence of abuse be turned over to authorities in a very short period of time, usually 24 or 48 hours.

        <h2 class="preview__title">Anti-Cruelty Laws</h2>
        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
            All fifty states have anti-cruelty laws. Some list animal cruelty as a felony, carrying a possible prison term, while others have kept it as a misdemeanor. Each state divides cruelty into various degrees, such as intentional or aggravated, which raise the level of the offense and carry a higher degree of punishment. The anti-cruelty laws are an uneven patchwork of local and state laws which vary dramatically from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. To determine your own state's regulations, each state's anti-cruelty laws are summarized in the following website.

        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
            The question I hear more than any other is “What can I do to help animals?” The number one thing you can do to help animals (and your own health) is this: don’t eat them. By far the greatest amount of animal suffering comes from the way animals are raised for food or dairy products.<br />The happy farms with green grass that you see on the side of dairy products seldom exist anymore. It is far more likely that the pigs you eat and the cows whose milk you drink were raised in terrible, cramped conditions.

        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
            I have written so much about animal suffering that it feels right to relate the many stories of human kindness. I believe people are basically good and if they only knew what goes on behind the scenes then most would choose compassion over cruelty. That is why I write these short essays.<br />Millions of everyday people, driving to work or home, go out of their way to do kind things. Here is an inspiring video about people rescuing animals from dangerous situations, often at risk to themselves.

        <h2 class="preview__title">Ecotourism</h2>
        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
            Ecotourism refers to travel that is consciously planned to support ecosystems and local cultures. The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) states that ecotourism is "responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people". This intent distinguishes it from most tourism because it emphasizes small scale, non-intrusive values and discourages the construction of hotels, resorts and highways which would be destructive to the wildlife, land and local cultures in the long run. Simply being out in nature or in a remote area of the world does not, by itself, constitute environmentalism.

        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
            In any discussion of ecotourism the dangers of "greenwashing" must be explored. Greenwashing is the use of misleading advertisements to suggest that an activity is good for the environment when objectively it is not. Wildlife theme parks, underwater hotels and motorized tours into fragile ecosystems strive to portray themselves as environmentally positive (or neutral) but they are not. True ecotourism builds environmental awareness while emphasizing human rights and local control over resources and development. It is not solely about animals but also about the humans who live there, and have lived there in the past, often for thousands of years.

        <p class="preview__snippet" style="-webkit-box-orient: vertical;">
            What constitutes a good animal shelter? There are traditional benchmarks which are commonly used to describe a good shelter, i.e. does it have a high adoption rate and a low euthanasia rate? But these do not begin to answer the question of whether this is a good shelter because there are are so many factors that affect these measures. For example, the shelter may be located in an area with extreme poverty so there will be less money to advertise adoptions or support spay and neuter programs.
