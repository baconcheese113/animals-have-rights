            <strong>Larry Weiss</strong> is a retired attorney who earned a B.A. from the University of Chicago and a
            law degree at the University of California at Berkeley. He practiced law in California for 36 years, first
            as a criminal defense attorney and then in the field of animal law. Larry specialized in the defense of
            animal activists.<br /><br />
            Larry believes that the exploitation of animals is a branch of the pervasive tree of dominance that exists
            within our society. "If we create a culture of true respect and compassion toward animals then this will
            change everything."
          </p>
          <p class="bios__bio">
            <strong>Janet Hastings</strong> moved to the U.S. from the U.K. in 1967. As an environmentalist, her
            priorities in life include the pursuit of arts, crafts and furniture restoration using only recycled
            materials. This has led to many adventures and the fun of dumpster diving, helping to keep some of the
            earth's resources out of the landfills.<br /><br />Janet's greatest passion is her pursuit of reducing
            suffering of animals. This passion motivated her to create a native wildlife garden, follow a vegan diet,
            and encourage awareness of the pitfalls of human overpopulation, which typically leads to cruel exploitation
            of both animals and the environment.
