      <p class="post__body">
          In any discussion of ecotourism the dangers of "greenwashing" must be explored. Greenwashing is the use of misleading advertisements to suggest that an activity is good for the environment when objectively it is not. Wildlife theme parks, underwater hotels and motorized tours into fragile ecosystems strive to portray themselves as environmentally positive (or neutral) but they are not. True ecotourism builds environmental awareness while emphasizing human rights and local control over resources and development. It is not solely about animals but also about the humans who live there, and have lived there in the past, often for thousands of years.<br /><br />

          If you are considering an environmentally responsible trip you need to be aware of this greenwashing phenomenon. There are usually reviews online that will help you discern the intent of the individuals promoting the trip. Are they genuinely respectful toward indigenous cultures and the environment? Does a portion of the proceeds go to protect habitat? Ask questions. If they are just about the money, honey, then don't go.<br /><br />

          There is no international organization which reviews and rates the true environmental impact of ecotourism companies and their promotions. However, there are quite a few national or regional organizations that undertake this task. Costa Rica, for example, runs the Certification of Sustainable Tourism (CST) program which focuses on a company's interaction with natural and cultural resources, the impact of its operations upon quality of life within local communities, and its economic contribution to other programs of national development. It utilizes a 0 to 5 grading system that rates a company upon the sustainability of its operations.<br /><br />

          If you are interested in this subject as a career, then your best resource is The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) which offers an ecotourism master class and awards a certificate in sustainable tourism management.<strong>- Larry</strong><br /><br />

        nstead of the obvious and humane response of providing better living conditions for the animals, agribusiness responds to these conditions by the routine use of antibiotics and thereby endangers human health. There is considerable public concern over this issue. A Consumer Reports Poll in 2012 found the following:<br /><br />
