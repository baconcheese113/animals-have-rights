          Background of the Animal Rights Movement

      <p class="post__body">
        The animal rights movement is often considered to have been an outgrowth of the environmental movement, but it
        actually preceded the environmental movement by about 100 years. It was part of a movement that began just after
        the Civil War, both in England and in the United States, for the protection of children and animals.<br /><br />

        The children's rights movement kept growing. Laws were passed in every state criminalizing cruelty against
        children, prohibiting child labor, and requiring that children attend school. Social agencies were created and
        funded to enforce these new laws protecting children.<br /><br />

        But an odd thing happened to the animal protection movement: it stopped abruptly after the passage of
        anti-cruelty laws, which all 50 states have in place. Those laws read pretty much the same today as they did in
        the 1880s and 1890s when most of them were passed.<br /><br />

        Why did protection for animals stop there? Because animals were considered property. Children were not property,
        but animals were and the movement could never get over this barrier.<br /><br />

        The movement to improve the lives of animals began again in the 1970s. It is usually called the "modern animal
        right movement" to distinguish it from what occurred in the 1870s. It has elements of both animal welfare and
        animal rights but a new element has been added, that of animal law.<br /><br />

        When I went to law school in the mid 60s, there was no such thing as animal law. Issues relating to animals were
        taught, piecemeal, in property law, criminal law, and administrative law classes.<br /><br />

        But in the 1970s a few people (notably Joyce Tischler of the Animal Legal Defense Fund) began to conceive of
        animal law as a unity, a field with a center and interrelated parts that could be taught as such. Due to this
        new unified conception the various parts began to interweave with one another and to be taught as a single unit.
        As a result of this, cross-referencing between laws in different codes became more common. For example, changes
        in the cruelty laws were incorporated into the agricultural codes so that animals raised for food would be
        treated more humanely.<br /><br />

        An important distinction needs to be made between animal law and animal rights. Animal law concerns any legal
        issues relating to animals, for example the writing of a contract for the transport of cows or pigs to a
        slaughterhouse. But that is not the type of law I practiced. I would not take a case if it did not help the
        condition of animals. My goal then and now is to reach a place where animals are not regarded as property but
        rather as feeling beings, such as ourselves, deserving of rights and protection. I am striving for a legal
        system that protects animals by a system of guardianship similar to that applicable to children. I believe that
        when we are considered as their guardians, not their owners, the world will be a better place for us all. That
        is animal rights. <strong>- Larry</strong>
