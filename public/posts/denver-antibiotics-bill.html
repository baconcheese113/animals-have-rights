          (a) Commencing January 1, 2016, all Denver City and County governmental agency personnel charged with purchasing poultry products for human consumption by the City and County of Denver pursuant to Title II, Revised Municipal Code, Chapter 20, Article IV Division 2, shall not purchase chicken products produced with the nontherapeutic use of medically important antimicrobial drugs.<br /><br />

          (c)  For purposes of this section, “chicken products” means any chicken carcasses or parts thereof that are purchased in bulk. Excepted are soups, gravies, sauces, salads, pizzas and any food items that contain chicken as a minority ingredient.<br /><br />

          (d)  For purposes of this section, "medically important antimicrobial” means any drug, or drug in  the same antimicrobial class as a drug, that is used by humans or intended for use by humans to treat or prevent disease or infection caused by micro-organisms and is identified as medically important (important, highly important, or critically important) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Appendix A of FDA’s Guidance for Industry #152 or subsequent listing by the FDA including, but not limited to, any drug or derivative of a drug that is composed wholly or partly of any of the following classes: penicillin, tetracycline, macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin, aminoglycoside, sulfonamide, or cephalosporin.<br /><br />

          (e)  For purposes of this section, "nontherapeutic” use means any use of a drug listed in subsection (d) herein as a feed or water additive, or in poultry hatcheries through any means, except to treat sick birds under the supervision of a veterinarian, for the purposes of growth promotion, feed efficiency, weight gain, routine disease prevention, or other routine purpose in the absence of any clinical sign of disease in the animal.<br /><br />

          (f)  For purposes of this section, "certify" means a written statement signed by an authorized representative of the supplier, stating that the chicken product has not been produced by methods involving the nontherapeutic use of drugs identified as medically important (important, highly important, or critically important) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Appendix A of FDA’s Guidance for Industry #152 or subsequent listing by the FDA.<br /><br />
