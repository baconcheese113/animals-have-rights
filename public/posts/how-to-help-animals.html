      <h2 class="post__title">How To Help Animals</h2>

      <p class="post__body">
        The question I hear more than any other is “What can I do to help
        animals?” The number one thing you can do to help animals (and your own
        health) is this: don’t eat them. By far the greatest amount of animal
        suffering comes from the way animals are raised for food or dairy
        products.<br /><br />

        The happy farms with green grass that you see on the side of dairy
        products seldom exist anymore. It is far more likely that the pigs you
        eat and the cows whose milk you drink were raised in terrible, cramped
        conditions. Eating less meat and dairy is something that each of us can
        do that will make an enormous difference. It doesn’t require political
        or legislative action. It is within our own power.<br /><br />

        How would becoming vegetarian or vegan make a difference to our health
        and the welfare of animals? First of all, let’s define each word: Being
        “vegetarian” means that you do not eat any meat including poultry and
        fish. I am frequently asked “Well, you eat chicken and fish, don’t you?”
        The answer is no, I do not now and I never did when I was a vegetarian
        (I am now vegan).<br /><br />
      </p>

        Any living being that has a face deserves our compassion. Really, what
        is the difference between eating a pig and eating a dog? They both have
        feelings and a need for food, shelter and love. So why do we eat one and
        not the other?<br /><br />

        Now, what does it mean to be a “vegan”? A vegan does not eat any animal
        products and this includes milk, butter, eggs and honey. The dairy
        industry is just as cruel to animals as the meat industry, keeping them
        in small crates or constantly lactating in unnatural conditions and
        stressful environments, so we don’t want to support that either. Neither
        will vegans use animal-based products for clothing, or any other
        purpose.<br /><br />

        purpose.<br /><br />

        When we look at it honestly, it is apparent that meat eating and dairy
        consumption are hurtful to our health, the environment, and certainly
        for the animals. Consider the impact of meat eating on world hunger.
        What an enormous waste of resources to take 10 to 15 pounds of healthful
        grain and use it as feed to produce one pound of meat which will clog
        your arteries! If we were to give the grain and soybeans to people we
        could feed everybody on the planet.<br /><br />

        Eating meat has a similarly destructive impact on the environment. The
        world’s rain forests are being destroyed, particularly in South America,
        to provide grazing land for cattle. These rain forests are the lungs of
        the planet and their disappearance greatly reduces our planet’s ability
        to transform carbon dioxide into oxygen. This, in turn, leads to
        increased global warming.<br /><br />

      <p class="post__body">
        An additional byproduct of animal agriculture is the pollution of our
        waters because the herbicides, pesticides, fungicides which are utilized
        all end up, eventually, in our water table along with vast amounts of
        manure and nitrogen fertilizers.
        <br /><br />

        Lastly, what does meat eating do to our health? Currently prevalent
        diseases such as heart attack, cancer and diabetes, all directly tied to
        eating meat, would be greatly reduced if we were to become vegetarian or
        vegan. Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and legumes contain no
        cholesterol and are low in fat, especially saturated fats. They are high
        in fiber and many plant based foods such as beans, peanuts, and soya,
        are good sources of protein. Another benefit is a lower risk of obesity
        due to the fact that plant-based foods are very low in calories.<br /><br />

        Also, vegans and vegetarians take in more fiber, which make their diet
        more filling on fewer calories. <br /><br /><strong>- Larry</strong

      <blockquote>
        “It is a beautiful gift that we can give the world to ease suffering,
        stop the killing of billions of animals, drastically reduce global
        warming, and lower rates of obesity and chronic degenerative diseases.
        With the abundance of plant-based options and a little bit of commitment
        and integrity, it’s easy. Why would we not do this for a more peaceful,
        compassionate future?” - Hope Bohanec,
