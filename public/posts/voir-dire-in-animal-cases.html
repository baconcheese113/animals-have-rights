      <h2 class="post__title">Effective Voir Dire In Animal Cases</h2>

      <blockquote>
        The following is reprinted from Vol. 2, ANIMAL LAW, <br />

      <p class="post__body">
        How to pick a jury in animal cases is a subject that has not been
        explored extensively. Most civil cases involving animals are settled;
        criminal cases are usually negotiated. However, if a case goes to trial,
        you will have an extensive examination of the jury panel, and I want to
        suggest some ideas you can use in selecting the jury.<br /><br />

        Picking a jury begins with a process called voir dire, which means "to
        speak the truth;" however, that is hardly an accurate appraisal of what
        goes on in a jury selection process. Both attorneys - the attorney for
        the state and the attorney for the defense if it is a criminal case (or
        the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant if it is a civil case)
        - are allowed to participate in the selection of a jury by using
        challenges. Challenges are of two kinds. First, there is a challenge for
        cause. You may lodge a challenge for cause to a prospective juror if
        that juror indicates that he or she is prejudiced against your client,
        prejudiced against a class of people to which your client belongs, or
        knows somebody in the case.<br /><br />
      </p>

        alt="tilthead"
      /><br /><br />

      <p class="post__body">
        A challenge for cause requires the judge's concurrence; if the judge
        agrees, the challenge for cause is granted, and the prospective juror is
        out. Generally, there are few successful challenges for cause because
        most prospective jurors, unless they want to get out of the case, will
        say the obvious thing: "No, I am not prejudiced; I will give this person
        an objective ear." So, you have to use "peremptory" challenges, the
        number of which varies from state to state and jurisdiction to
        jurisdiction.<br /><br />

        The questions that you can ask potential jurors are those aimed at
        determining whether to challenge for cause. That is what the codes all
        say; you are trying to find out if this person is prejudiced. However,
        what you are really doing is trying to find out if you like this
        prospective juror, and whether the prospective juror is going to be
        sympathetic to your client. In my cases, I want to find out if the
        prospective juror has any animal sympathies or not. <br /><br />

        I will address the subject of voir dire in two parts. First is the issue
        of what kinds of questions you should ask the panel of prospective
        jurors to find out if they are sympathetic to your cause. Second is how
        to present your questions procedurally so the judge will not quash
        them.<br /><br />

        The first issue is: What kind of questions should you ask? You can ask
        the usual set of questions concerning the potential juror's employment.
        This is often a veritable gold mine because animal exploitative
        employment is rampant and you will want to find out the prospective
        juror's occupation. Is this a person in livestock? Is he a rancher? Is
        he a ranch hand? Does he work in a meat market or a rodeo? Does this
        person sell pharmaceuticals that are tested on animals?<br /><br />

        You can ask, very innocently, about the person's occupation and receive
        important information. If you uncover no animal-related occupations, you
        should ask: what was your previous occupation? The person may have only
        been working in the present position a year, perhaps before she was
        selling tickets to the rodeo. So, you want to go back a few years and
        find out if this person has ever done anything that constitutes animal
        exploitation.<br /><br />

        To understand the answers of prospective jurors, you have to understand
        what animal exploitation is; you have to do your homework. You have to
        know the products that are tested on animals. If the judge gives you a
        little leeway, you can get into what kind of products are sold at the
        store where the prospective juror works, whether she knows those
        products are tested on animals, and how she feels about these issues.
        Sometimes the judge will say that these types of questions are not
        relevant, but you ask them until the judge stops you. However, you
        cannot ask pertinent questions if you do not know what you are asking
        for.<br /><br />

        What I am suggesting is that in picking a jury, you have to know the
        various fields that are exploitative of animals, including product
        testing, medical testing, and the ethic surrounding livestock and
        agribusiness. What if the prospective juror is not a rancher or a
        cowhand, but is working somewhere in the feed business? Does this mean
        that he agrees that animal exploitation is okay? The answer usually is
        yes. The reason that employment is important is because people go
        voluntarily into employment. It is not like race or place of birth. One
        decides to be a rancher, and this says something about who one is
        because people decide to do things that are compatible with their own
        belief systems.<br /><br />

        You may want to also ask whether a prospective juror has any connection
        with the business or institution that was the subject of an animal
        rights demonstration. Take a hypothetical case involving a sit-in at a
        university. Assume that twelve people were arrested, but there was no
        property damage. You should determine from the panel of prospective
        jurors if anyone has any connection with the university. If some are
        students, you want to ask what their majors are. If a person is a
        science major, this may not be good because she is probably,
        statistically speaking, not an animal activist. If the person is going
        into science, she probably believes in the "scientific method" and
        supports animal testing. So, if this demonstration was against the
        testing of animals, you have a problem. After you ask about the person's
        major, you should ask if she believes that testing on animals is
        essential for human health. Get your big questions in first before the
        judge calls you to the bench and asks you what you are doing. Practicing
        attorneys understand that.<br /><br />

        What if the person is not a student, but is a professor? This could be
        okay depending on what the professor teaches. If she is a professor of
        philosophy, alternative women's studies, Chicano studies, Black studies,
        or something like this, it is a good sign because a person in that field
        has often taken on an alternative lifestyle, or at least has considered
        an alternative lifestyle to be acceptable. You may want to ask that
        person a little about her beliefs, if you can. I would say that somebody
        who is a professor at the university should not automatically be
        disqualified. You want to find out what she does at the university, and
        what her feelings about the university are.<br /><br />
      </p>

      /><br /><br />

      <p class="post__body">
        If the person is an alumnus, in my experience that is usually not good,
        and I have questioned a lot of prospective jurors. What alums usually
        have is a very rose-colored picture of what the college was like when
        they went to it. They do not like anybody criticizing their college. And
        you are criticizing their college, make no mistake, when you sit-in and
        refuse to get up. I usually challenge alums.<br /><br />

        The same holds true with employees of the college. Employees are in a
        bad position because if they are on a jury that acquits your client, and
        then have to go back and be a clerk the next day at the registration
        office, they are going to take some flak. So I would say that employees
        of the college should usually be challenged. This reasoning process may
        apply to any institution. I used the university as an example because
        sit-ins at colleges are my most common kind of case.<br /><br />

        If there is property damage - for example, say all the animals are let
        out of the lab - the case becomes much more difficult. You are now going
        to have to seek people with alternative lifestyles and beliefs. What you
        want to find is somebody who is not necessarily conversant with animal
        issues, but has endorsed protests in the past. For instance, if somebody
        has supported or sat in on a Vietnam demonstration, in a civil rights
        demonstration, or something similar in the past, she may be able to
        relate to your client. If you can ask these questions, if the judge will
        allow you this kind of latitude, you may have something. You might find
        a juror who will be sympathetic to your client's actions.
        <br /><br />

        Ask the prospective jurors where they went to college, even if they are
        not connected with your college. Ask them because going to college
        represents a lifestyle choice. Somebody who went to The Citadel is
        different from someone who went to Berkeley. They have made a choice;
        people want to associate with compatible people. If they went to college
        at a military school, they are going to have a certain set of beliefs,
        as opposed to places like UC-Berkeley or UC-Santa Cruz, where there are
        different sets of rules. So you want to find that out, and then you draw
        your own conclusions.<br /><br />

        If you know the significance of a college choice, you have a leg up on
        the opposition. The attorney on the other side might not see the
        significance. Then you have better information than the other side
        does.<br /><br />

        Get good information on prospective jurors in order to exercise your
        peremptory challenges. Even better, if you get that information without
        the other side knowing it, you may be, able to empanel a sympathetic
        juror without the other side knowing it. You can accomplish this by
        asking prospective jurors the kinds of questions that correlate to
        beliefs in animals or beliefs in a protest mentality, but are not the
        direct questions about beliefs.<br /><br />

        The kinds of questions you ask include: Do you have any "companion
        animals?" Do you know what a companion animal is? If she says, "Yes, I
        have two cats," ask whether or not the cats are spayed or neutered? She
        may answer, "No, I would never do a thing like that." There is your
        information. She may say, "Yes, of course I have a spayed animal; there
        are too many animals." There is your information. The other side may not
        know the implication of having a spayed or an unspayed animal because
        they are not sensitive to animal rights issues.<br /><br />

        You can also ask, "Where did you buy your dog?" If she bought it from a
        breeder, that is different from buying from a shelter. This is the kind
        of information you can get if you know what you are doing, and the other
        side does not. They may not know that you are getting important
        information.<br /><br />

        Another area you want to pursue (although this is hard because judges
        often declare these questions irrelevant) is information about the diet
        of the prospective juror. If this person is a vegetarian, this is
        essential information. If the judge will not let you ask that question,
        you might just throw out a question about diet or about the meat
        industry. If a prospective juror makes any comment about being a
        vegetarian or even just uses the word "vegetarian," you have your
        information.<br /><br />

        Another important piece of information has to do with possession of
        weapons. If you simply ask, "Are you a hunter?," everyone will know what
        you are doing. However, if you can find out that the prospective juror
        owns weapons, you know there is a statistical correlation between owning
        weapons -- being a hunter -- and being unsympathetic to animals.<br /><br />

        If you can find out whether this person owns weapons, you have a lot of
        information about how that person is likely to view your case. Most
        people that own weapons are not going to like your clients.<br /><br />

        The second issue concerning peremptory challenges is how to proceed
        procedurally so that you will be allowed to ask prospective jurors the
        kinds of questions that are useful to you.<br /><br />

        The most important classes you take in law school are classes such as
        Civil Procedure and Criminal Procedure. They might seem to be the least
        interesting classes, but they are the ones you are going to use the
        most. You need to know how to do a demurrer and a summary judgment, and
        you must know how to do a pleading. The other stuff you can look up in
        the library. One bit of wisdom I want to pass along is: listen in your
        procedure classes. It will save you again and again. <br /><br />

        How do you get your questions before the jury? The way that I have done
        it most successfully is to make a motion well in advance presenting to
        the judge all the voir dire questions. Know your voir dire questions and
        submit them to the judge. This will get the judge thinking about your
        issues, and you may get more latitude when you finally get your chance
        to question the panel. Procedurally what happens is that the judge
        questions the jurors first and asks questions designed to discover if
        prospective jurors are prejudiced, if they know anybody in the case, or
        is it going to destroy their business to sit through the case. These are
        automatic questions and few people are challenged for cause on the basis
        of these questions because all the prospective jurors know the right
        answers to give if they want to sit on the jury. Then you get your turn
        to ask questions. Depending on the judge and the case, you may have five
        minutes to ask questions per prospective juror or ten minutes per
        prospective juror.<br /><br />

        In one case that I did, the San Quentin Six, we were given up to half an
        hour per juror, but that was an unusual case involving five counts of
        murder. You want the most time you can get to question each juror
        because then you can engage in a dialogue and ask open-ended questions.
        Do not ask closed questions such as "do you hate animals?" or "do you
        like Michigan State University?" Ask questions that are open-ended like
        "what do you think about animal testing?" Let the prospective jurors
        talk, because you will get to know a little bit about them.<br /><br />

        How do you get your questions to the jurors? You make a motion in
        advance and you submit pages of voir dire questions. You ask the judge's
        permission either to ask those questions yourself or for the judge to
        ask those questions. You ask in your motion, "your honor, would you ask
        these questions of the jurors?" At the pre-trial conference the judge
        usually says, "counsel, I am not going to ask all these questions." At
        that time, you explain the importance of your questions, and why the
        views of the individual jurors on animal issues are essential to picking
        a fair jury. You should use analogies that you can find in the casebooks
        concerning other cognizable classes of people. You explain to the judge
        that there exists substantial prejudice against animal rights activists
        as a class.
        <br /><br />

        The judge may ask only one or two of your questions, perhaps what
        prospective jurors think about animal rights. However, the rest of the
        submitted questions may serve the purpose of having the judge go to the
        law library, look them up, and think about them in advance so when you
        get up and start asking your voir dire questions, the judge will not
        quash you. However, if you spring a big surprise on the judge, he or she
        is not going to be happy and might call you up to the bench, embarrass
        you, and then you are off on the wrong foot. So you want to give plenty
        of warning, advising the judge you are going to want to ask these types
        of questions. If you do that, the judge will appreciate it, and you
        might get more latitude in questioning. So put your questions in a
        motion. Voir dire is not the time to spring surprises; surprises are for
        later in the trial.<br /><br />

        Suppose the judge does not allow you to ask any questions. Suppose the
        judge says, "Well, sorry counsel, this is all irrelevant, you are not
        going to ask prospective jurors what they think about this, the only
        issue at hand was whether this person was sitting down on state
        university property."<br /><br />

        You then at least have a paper trail in case you decide to appeal. There
        are many ways to approach a prospective juror, but what you want to do
        is to sincerely talk to them the way that I am now talking to you. You
        do not want to stand up and read off some list. They do not want to hear
        that. You should talk to them, and you should get a feeling for who a
        prospective juror is as a person. This is the most important part of
        your case. You could have the greatest case in the world, but if the
        jury is looking at you like you are from Mars, you have had it. This has
        happened to me several times when I have had to argue to a jury the
        premise that animals are not property.<br /><br />

        Because you are arguing premises that may be unfamiliar to the jury,
        another purpose of voir dire is to set forth premises early. For
        example, the idea that it is wrong to use animals for medical testing
        may not exist in a prospective juror's universe. Suppose a prospective
        juror has been using medications tested on animals for years and thinks
        they are great. Now you are telling her that testing is wrong. You must
        say so early in your voir dire; if you put the idea out there early,
        then later when you argue it in your closing statement, the jury will at
        least be familiar with your premise.<br /><br />

        In your closing statement, you can then draw analogies to other social
        movements that were ahead of their times, such as the movements against
        slavery, child cruelty, and child employment.<br /><br />

        The last time I had to argue an animal issue, I had to do it in a very
        rural county in northern California. It was hard. It always is hard when
        you get blank stares, but that is why you are doing this kind of work. I
        assume you are here because you are not trying to make more money for
        corporate America; if so, you would not be here. So, you are going to
        have to argue alternative viewpoints, and you are going to have to know
        your audience.<br /><br />

        You need to believe in your clients in order to stand up there and speak
        for them because these people are not criminals; they were acting out of
        conscience. Say that to the jury. The system does not differentiate
        between people that sit in as an act of conscience and people that are
        out there stealing things. You do that; that is your job. You should be
        very proud of what you do. It is a great thing; it is a
        privilege.<strong>- Larry</strong><br /><br />
