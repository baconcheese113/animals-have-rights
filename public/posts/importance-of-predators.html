      <p class="post__body">
        We have inherited an earth in danger and that danger is particularly apparent in the war on predators that we
        have waged for centuries. Predators are essential to any ecosystem because they keep the prey species in balance
        with what the ecosystem can support. <br /><br />

        Predators and prey will always come to a balance because if there are too many predators (e.g. wolves, coyotes,
        mountain lions, bears) the prey species will decline in numbers. The predators will then not have sufficient
        food and they will decline until there is sufficient balance for the prey species to recover. Then the cycle
        will repeat.
        <br /><br />

        People have interrupted this cycle in numerous ways. Pollution, fences, logging, mining and loss of habitat, all
        symptomatic of human overpopulation, have disrupted this natural cycle. There has been a wholesale destruction
        of essential prey species, such as prairie dogs, by builders and developers. Organizations such as Prairie Dog
        Coalition, a project of the Humane Society of the United States, work to preserve these keystone species and
        thus the entire ecosystems which depend on them. <br /><br />

        One factor in the decline of predators has been the use of lead ammunition. Lead is toxic to living ecosystems.
        Because of its toxicity, lead has been removed from paint and gasoline, and yet it is still allowed as
        ammunition in most states. Predators will die or suffer extremely negative long term effects from the ingestion
        of just one lead shotgun pellet. Scavengers who then eat the carcasses will suffer the same effects and so it
        gets passed along the food chain.<br /><br />

        Probably most damaging has been the wanton destruction of predators by bounties placed upon the skins of
        predators such as coyotes and wolves. Governmental agencies and bounty hunters were rewarded for killing as many
        predators as possible. Australia currently offers a bounty on foxes. Sadly, hunting and ranching organizations
        have traditionally applauded this approach.<br /><br />

        <img class="post__image" src="../images/JanetArt/naked-on-blue.jpg" alt="wildways map" /><br /><br />

        There is a new awareness of the importance of predators to any wild ecosystem. When the wolves were returned to
        Yellowstone in 1995, they preyed on the deer which meant that the deer populations were brought more into
        balance with the ecosystem. Wolves take the old and weakest, who cannot escape, while hunters shoot the largest
        and most healthy so they can hang their horns on a wall. The effect of this is that the healthiest animals in
        the herd do not get the chance to procreate. Thus the wolves keep the species healthier in the long run while
        the hunters keep it weaker.<br /><br />

        There is a fascinating video on this subject which shows how the return of the wolves to Yellowstone
        reinvigorated the entire ecosystem. Wolves slimmed down the deer herds, which in turn allowed the grasses, which
        the deer had been eating vociferously, to return to the riverbed.<br /><br />

        This, in turn, lead to more stable foundations for the river’s banks which allowed the fish and beavers to
        return. This lead to its repopulation by frogs, salamanders and other river-dwelling species which in turn
        provide food for the predators.<br /><br />

          What are the practical implications of this for those of us who love animals and want to protect
          wildlife?</span
        ><br /><br />

        Nature will return to a healthy balance if we just keep out of its way. It may take decades, depending on the
        amount of damage we have caused, but it will occur. <strong>- Larry</strong><br /><br />
